# Family Task Manager Development Guidelines

## Version Management
- Keep stable versions with clear tagging (e.g. version with working image cropper)
- Revert to stable version instead of trying to fix problematic code
- Document major changes and stable points in the codebase

## Code Structure
- Clear separation between classes:
  * FamilyTaskManager: Data and business logic
  * ImageCropper: Image handling
  * UIManager: User interface management
- Maintain one central JavaScript file instead of splitting into many files
- Use clear code comments and documentation
- Keep consistent naming conventions in Hebrew

## Feature Management
- Don't add new features to stable version without thorough testing
- Better to remove problematic features than leave them broken
- Maintain core features like image cropping
- Test new features in isolation before integration

## Debugging and Problem Solving
- Use console.log with emojis for easy identification (ðŸŽ¯ for cropper, ðŸ“· for images, etc.)
- Check styling changes (like green button color)
- Return to stable version when facing complex issues
- Document known issues and their solutions

## UI/UX Considerations
- Importance of user feedback (success messages)
- Maintain consistent design
- Full Hebrew language support
- Clear user navigation and state management
- Proper error handling and user notifications

## Best Practices
- Regular testing of core functionality
- Clear separation of concerns
- Consistent error handling
- Regular backups of user data
- Clean and maintainable code structure
